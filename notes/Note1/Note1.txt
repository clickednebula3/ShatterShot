//BOSSES
- Bounding Box
	(Bounding Box gets cut, changes size during game, potentially moves)
	# [c] power?
	# yellow -> shoot wall
	# blue -> bounce on ball
	# green -> throw shield on wall
	# aqua -> parry wall (make it look halarious)
	# red -> act+arrowkey, just touch it and push it (like the sans fight)
	# purple -> little spiders could push wall (or not), more spider = faster, big spider pushes wall a constant amount
	# orange -> bounce
	# white -> 
- Triangle
	(spawns outside of Bounding Box if there is enough negative space, spawns monsters of the player's color)
	# gets squished by Bounding Box
- Cube
	(wanders around in Bounding Box, if it touches the player, it will catch it and player will have to press Z repeatidly to escape)
	(when player is caught, the Bounding Box slowly shrinks, and grows with each Z)
	#spam z before it's too late!

> "final smash" is a colorful orb
> if one 1 HP for any soul: heal (to max?) instead
- Orange: bigger, or throws self-clones around (they fade)
- Yellow: Laser, Bomb, Rapid Fire, Auto-Aim (maybe random?)
- Purple: Big Spider (moves in a straight line (like dvd), kills N monsters) 
- Blue: yeet, jump off of background instead of just wall
- Aqua: freeze everyone for an amount of time
- Red: DVD (but ensured)
- Green: The shield can be fully turned while it moves,
- White: black hole (like hyper goner), 

//white mode
	(still gravity (around mouse/aim))
	(Kills all enemies by touching them, has timer bar)
	(timer bar assigns a 'hit-target' color for white to kill (color of one of the mon on screen))
	(white must kill one mon in that color in time or get hit)
